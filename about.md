I like to live my life with a Lighthouse Mindset.  The Lighthouse Mindset is something that helped me become who I am today.
There was a time when metaphorically I felt as though I was living a life lost at sea.  Doomed to aimlessly wander the dark and wavy sea
in what seemed like a perpetual everlasting night time.

There were cerain very special individuals who frequented my life that helped guide me to find real meaning and purpose in life.  Those
people live life with what I like to call a Lighthouse Mindset.  They used their experience, wisdom and knowledge to share the happiness they found in life with not just for myself, but for all who wanted it.

**The aid of a Lighthouse Mind is never forced upon anyone, but rather is displayed freely for those who are willing to learn from it.**

I will always be forever thankful for those who helped guide me home when I was lost at sea.

Now I am ready to use my strength, experiences and struggles to help others.  
I want to share my problems and how I persevere and overcome them with anyone who aims to overcome their struggles.  
I want to guide others to strive to be the best people that they can be.  
And then teach them to treat others the same way.  

Lighthouses for the masses.
