I have a deep love for hip-hop music.  Not just any hip-hop though, hip-hop with a deep level of profound lyricism.  That's why today I will start my topic with a relevant bar that I believe in, dropped by Hopsin years ago...


> "_Living is naturally **hell**,   
>   You have to **work** to put a smile on._"  
>                           **-Hopsin** 


Now if you don't know me personally, you may not know that I have not exactly always had high levels of dedication.  In fact, most of my life I had difficulties allocating time towards anything that would truly benefit myself in the long run.  Why am I sharing this on a blog that can be read by prospective employers?  Because I'm real.  I believe in honesty.  I haven't always been the person I am today, and I hope I can persuade others to not waste so much of their time like I did for so many years.
